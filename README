TCC

These are Perl bindings to the Tiny C Compiler (TCC). TCC is a very fast, very 
small, and nearly compliant C-99 compiler (sans complex numbers, I believe). 
Some benchmarks claim that TCC compiles 7x faster than GCC. TCC does not apply 
the same sorts of optimizations as GCC, mind you, but it still compiles to 
machine code. Another important feature of TCC is that it can compile a string 
of C code to machine code without writing to file. In other words, it can be 
used as a Just In Time C compiler!

If you do not yet see my point, then consider this: Perl has excellent string
manipulation facilities. By combining Perl's ability to manipulate strings and
TCC's ability to quickly compile C code, we have an easy, fast way to
dynamically generate machine code. Perl's bytecode is fast, of course, but for
certain numerical work, this can lead to operations that are orders of magnitude
faster.

(Though, admitedly, I don't yet have the benchmarks to prove my point.)
